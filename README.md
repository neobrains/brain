# brain

Yet another unix package manager written in bash.

## Why?

Yes , we know you got flatpak, but we wanted to create our own package manager , though it will not support many packages , but it will support the packages that have issues with flatpak. For example , with flatpak installed discord / vscode there are some known issues , but with brain installed discord / vscode there are no issues as we install then using the tar.gz / deb / rpm / etc. files.

## Installation

```bash
curl -sL https://neobrains.dev/brain | bash
```

or

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neobrains/brain/main/install.sh | bash
```
